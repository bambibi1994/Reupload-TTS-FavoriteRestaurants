    <p>This is my favorite food because you can eat it by itself or with anything else</p>
    <p>without losing it taste. Chinese roast pork also is the food that I use to judge</p>
    <p>any asian restaurant skill in cooking and select ingredients. It is one of two food</p>
    <p>that we always have when have party in house alongside with eggroll. With correct</p>
    <p>ingredients and cooking skill, you will feel cripy skin, melting fat, and tasteful </p>
    <p>meat in your mouth in one bite. I Always recommend it to any non-asian people when </p>
    <p>it comes to asian cuisine.</p>
